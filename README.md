# LostAges - P-Seminar Project

## About the Project
**LOSTAGES** is a **2D top-down action-adventure** game developed as part of a **school project (P-Seminar)** by a team of seven students, two of whom are working remotely from abroad. The game is developed using **Unity (C#)** with a **PostgreSQL database** for account/game score management.

## Storyline
### Prologue
X starts in a cave, solving simple puzzles and discovering an ancient structure. After interacting with a mysterious pocket watch, X unlocks a hidden path leading outside. A cinematic cutscene reveals the **open world** before transitioning to the game title.

### Main Story
X meets **Chronos**, who provides a combat tutorial and assigns the first major quest: activating four monuments to charge a crystal. This crystal, supposedly a way to escape the starting area, actually serves as a prison for Chronos. Believing Zeus to be the antagonist, X embarks on a journey to obtain **three Time Orbs (Past, Present, Future)** from different kingdoms to create a portal to Zeus.

### Kingdoms and Quests
1. **Futura** – Solve an ancient rune puzzle and decode a lost recipe.
2. **Instantia** – Retrieve the stolen Time Orb by stealthily infiltrating a criminal hideout.
3. **Retrosum** – Win an intense gladiatorial tournament to claim the final Time Orb.

### Final Battle
After acquiring all three Orbs, X returns to the starting area, where Chronos' true nature is revealed. Instead of Zeus being the villain, **Chronos was the true enemy all along**. After defeating Zeus, Chronos absorbs the Orbs' power and transforms into the final boss. The ultimate showdown takes place in the **After World**, culminating in Chronos being frozen in time for eternity.
